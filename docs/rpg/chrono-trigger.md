## Chrono Trigger

Download The original USA version of Chrono Trigger SNES ROM

## MSU-1 Patch

The ROM needs to be patched to enable MSU-1 sound.

Download the MSU-1 patch from here:
[Chrono Trigger MSU-1 Patch](https://www.mediafire.com/file/l5dq6hsynnuf0ox/CT_MSU-1_Patch.zip/file)

Patch the ROM with the downloaded .bps file here:

## MSU-1 Soundtrack

A soundtrack needs to be placed alongside the rom file in the same folder, with music in .pcm format.

While the soundtrack has been provided in the correct format to use in game, you can support the author by purchasing the licensed music from here:

## Compatible Emulator

The BSNES core in Retroarch is capable of playing MSU-1 roms. Ensure the rom file and .pcm files have matching names so they are detected. Ensure you own a copy of Chrono Trigger before playing and enable error detection in core settings.
