Extract the contents of the zip file into the gameâ€™s folder, in the same directory as the `FEAR.exe` file

## Soft Shadows

For soft shadows to work in F.E.A.R properly, disable *FXAA* & *VSync* in the game's settings menu.

## Vulkan Wrapper (Optional)

**DXVK** Makes the game run with Vulkan API instead of DirectX 9, providing better performance and compatibility with other enhancements.

Visit the GitHub repo and download the latest release.

[DXVK Download](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk)

Extract the contents of `dxvk-2.5.3.tar.gz`, then open the `x86` folder, drag & drop `dxd9.dll` in to the game's folder.

## ReShade (Optional)

**ReShade** Can be used to enhance the game's textures, lighting and colour.

[ReShade Download](https://reshade.me)

Follow instructions on ReShade's website to install it in F.E.A.R. If you added the DXVK Vulkan wrapper, install it using Vulkan, otherwise use DirectX 9.
